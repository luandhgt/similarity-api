    - Look at ALL images to get complete picture
    - Identify the primary mechanic (what drives progression and rewards)
    - Don't confuse core loop rewards with event-specific rewards
    - Event-specific currencies/points with no real value shouldn't affect reward classification
    - For reskins/updates, note any changes in: Name, Theme, Graphics, Pricing, Mechanics, Rewards
